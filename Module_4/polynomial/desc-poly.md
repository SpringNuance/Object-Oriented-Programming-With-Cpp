**Objective:** Learn to overload various operators.

[Polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) is a mathematical 
expression consisting of terms summed to each-other. In this exercise you will 
implement class Poly, holding a single polynomial where each term is of form 
**mul**x**exp**. For example, the parabola 4xÂ²+2x+7 would be stored in the 
Poly object in a `std::map<int, int>` of pairs of exponent and multiplier: 
(2, 4), (1, 2), (0, 7).

The comments in file *poly.hpp* provide more detailed
instructions of the functions you will need to implement. You
will only need to modify *poly.cpp*.
