**Objective:** Get familiar with basic use of classes and methods,
learning to implement your own simple classes based on a given class
definition.

In this task you will implement a full class handling a bank account,
starting from constructor, along with a few functions for accessing
the class content and operating it. There is also one function outside
the class, *Transfer*, that will transfer money between two bank
accounts.

Read file *bank_account.hpp* carefully, there are comments on each
class member describing what the function should do, and based on the
comments you should write your implementation in *bank_account.cpp*

The given main function prints the following output when everything works:

    Owner: Rasse Rikas
    Number: 21345
    Balance: 0
    Depositing 100 to account.
    Balance: 100
    Withdrawing 50 from account.
    Balance: 50
    Trying to withdraw 100.
    Balance: 50
    Account num: 43662, owned by: Kaisa Kroisos, balance: 1000 eur.
    Transfering 100.0 from Kaisa Kroisos to Rasse Rikas.
    Transfer succesful!
    Transfering 500.0 from Rasse Rikas to Kaisa Kroisos.
    Transfer failed!
