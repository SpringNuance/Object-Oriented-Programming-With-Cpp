**Objective:** Practice basic handling of the *vector* type.

In this exercise you will need to implement the following three functions
that operate on given *int* - type vectors.

  * `GetMin` that will return the smallest value stored in the vector.

  * `GetMax` that will return the largest value stored in the vector.

  * `GetAverage` that will return the average of the values stored in the
    vector. The returned value will be of *double* type, even though
    the input values are *int*.

Instructions on how to run and test your programs locally are available
in Module 0.
