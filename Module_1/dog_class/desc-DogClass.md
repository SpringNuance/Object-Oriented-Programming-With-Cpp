**Objective:** Learn to construct the basic building blocks in class
definition, by fixing a broken class definition.

The exercise template contains a simple class **Dog** that has
(or is supposed to have) a constructor and a few small functions for
setting the age and the name of the dog, and asking them.
The class implements information hiding normally:
The class member variables should not be accessible directly from
outside the class, but the class state should be altered using the
functions that are accessible from elsewhere.

Both *dog_class.hpp* and *dog_class.cpp* contain errors that prevent
the program from compiling. Fix these errors such that the code compiles
and works correctly.

The main function should print the following output when everything works:

    The dog is called Mr. Wuf and it is 5 years old!

Instructions on how to run and test your programs locally are available
in Module 0.
