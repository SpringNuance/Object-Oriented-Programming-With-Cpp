**Objective:** More practice with containers.

In this exercise, you will implement three classes:

 - **Book** which holds information about a book
 - **Customer** which holds information about a customer
 - **Library** which collects together books, and customers loaning the books

You will need to start from finishing the definitions in the *.hpp* files
according to the instructions in the comments, and then implement the functions
in the *.cpp* files.

The tests for *Customer* and *Library* require full points from Book tests and 
*Library* tests requires full points from *Customer* tests. Therefore, the
recommended order of implementing is *Book*, *Customer*, and then *Library*. 
Getter functions are also required to get full points for the other tests to be run. 
Note that you still need to at least make dummy declarations and definitions for
the methods or you will not be able to compile the tests. You could also test
them yourself using the main function, in which case you do not need
dummy definitions for unused methods.

Instructions on how to run and test your programs locally are available
in Module 0.
