**Objective:** Learn to use iterators with vectors.

Implement three functions that operate on integer vectors in the
following manner:

**ReadVector** that will read numbers from user and stores them as
integer vector that is returned by the function. The function stops
reading when a non-numeric value is given by the user.

**PrintSum1** that calculates sums of pair of numbers in the vector
and prints them on the screen. The function will print the sum of
two consecutive numbers in vector, seprated by space. For example,
if the user gives the following input: `1 2 3 4 !`, the output
should be `3 5 7`, followed by a newline character. As can be seen,
the output will have one number less than the input.

**PrintSum2** that calculates sum of the first and last item in the
vector, then the sum of second and second-last item in the vector,
and so on, until all integers in the vector have been
processed. With input `1 2 3 4 !` the output will be `5 5`, followed
by newline.

Use iterators for walking through the vectors. The exact definitions
are available in the header file.

Instructions on how to run and test your programs locally are available
in Module 0.
